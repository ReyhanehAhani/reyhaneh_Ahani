## About Me

I am a Master of Science student in Computer Engineering at Simon Fraser University (SFU). I am currently a Research Assistant at the **Multimedia Communication Lab**, where my thesis focuses on Monocular Depth Estimation using Representation Learning. 

I also work as a **Data Analyst** at **SFU's Big Data Hub**. My primary research interests include Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and the optimization of Large Language/Vision Models (LLMs/VLMs).

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Monocular Depth Estimation, Representation Learning, Image Segmentation.
- **NLP & VLMs:** Fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT).
- **Machine Learning:** Deep Learning, Model Optimization.
